# utility function for melted data

# I guess in general it's about data processing. Most command can be done
# with data.table which quite fast and actually has the right syntax I think

# most common annoying task:
# - renaming things ( I should try to write a better renaming that uses patterns)
# - computation of aggregates / time dependent by group. I guess you would want something with the ability to use .I - 1
# - reshaping / appending particularly when the data is melted.


# things that tend to be painfull to do

# 1) you want to merge a data in long format based
# on a combination of values from variable and from ids...

# 2) a variable like optimal/random is present for lots
# of subcases, you want to say ... ~ subject + opt + random 
# to get the subject, then the optimal subject and the random
# subject 
# I think this is specification of a marginalization

# 3) you want to generate a new variable ( you can use ddply 
# but you need to get the value from the a data.frame, it's a
# bit annoying

# 4) combining when some columns are missing (but I guess this is a sort 
# of merge)


# I think a gcast function that would take sg like  var1 + var2 + var3 ~ var4 +var5 ....
# but where vars can be either level names or column names would be pretty awesome

# mcompute ( newvar = formula | ids ) 
# should use variable name in either col or levels, 
# if ... is given , then it should just do it by the variable that are mentioned
# basically trying to find the best set of id, the finer set of id ( risking doing it on sd as well ....)
